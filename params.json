{"name":"jSunPicker","tagline":"A simplified jQuery date and time picker","body":"## Why another Date picker?\r\nThere are numerous date, time pickers out there. However, each of those lack in one way or another. If they are feature-rich, they are bulky. If they are light-weight, they lack features. Some others which looked good are either abandoned or use jQuery UI!  Many lacked semantic declaration (declaring options as element attributes say, `data-` attribute) which is a deal breaker for me as most of my code is dynamically generated. Some good looking ones were so buggy that I wasted more time trying to debug than making use of it. I felt that things could be written simple and still be feature-rich. Thus was born this project.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\njSunPicker has the following features:\r\n* Light-weight - 12kb minified, 4kb gzipped\r\n* Supports datetime, date, time, month and year picker\r\n* Separate date and time formats for display and submit\r\n* Dedicated &hearts; button for current date and time\r\n* Semantic declaration - declare your options as javascript or as `data-` attributes or leave them at defaults\r\n* Supports all output formats and most input formats (to manually enter the date in the input element)\r\n* Date range restrictions - min-date, max-date and disable selected-dates (or ranges)\r\n* Time restrictions - min-time, max-time\r\n* Days restrictions - disable selective days (say, Sat & Sun)\r\n* Standardized date input formats for options \r\n* Customizable Title strings (multi-language support)\r\n* Customizable Start day (Monday can be your first day of the week)\r\n* Inline calendar or trigger from text field or custom icon\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n* [jQuery 1.8+](http://jquery.com/download/) \r\n* [jQuery.mousewheel](https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel) for time scroll.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nBasic usage with default options\r\n\r\n     $('selector').jSunPicker();\r\n\r\nSpecifying options in Javascript\r\n\r\n     $('selector').jSunPicker({startDay:1, pickerType:'date', displayFormat:'m/d/Y'});\r\n\r\nSemantic declaration (as selector's `data-` attributes)\r\nHTML: Declare the options breaking with hiphens at camel-case characters like below. jQuery converts them to camel-case.\r\n\r\n    <input id='datepicker' data-start-day = '1' data-picker-type = 'date' />\r\n\r\nJQuery: Basic markup.  Any undeclared option will be substituted by the default values.\r\n\r\n    $('#datepicker').jSunPicker();\r\n\r\n\r\n-- More usage examples will be created later -- \r\n\r\n## Inspiration\r\nHeavily inspired by [Will_pickdate() by TazSingh (@tazsingh)](http://tazsingh.github.io/will_pickdate/). Thanks TazSingh. I have been using that for more than a year but it has some serious bugs with min-max date restrictions. This has not been updated for a while and I also thought that the code could be lot simpler. So I borrowed the visual and navigation design (it was so beautiful) from that project and wrote my plugin from scratch.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nRavi Iyer (@sunalive)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n[MIT License](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license).
